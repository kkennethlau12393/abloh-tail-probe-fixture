/*
 * THE ENVELOPE MUST CARRY EVERY INPUT THE SERVER RE-DERIVES THE GATE FROM.
 *
 * The control plane does not accept the CLI's pass/fail. It recomputes the gate from the sanitized
 * findings and the policy it was sent, compares that to the gate the artifact was signed with, and
 * REFUSES the whole upload when the two disagree — draft.ts's `if (gate.status !== expectedOverall
 * .status) return bad(...)`, surfaced as 400 INVALID_CI_HANDOFF.
 *
 * That makes the policy pick in build-handoff.mjs load-bearing in a way an allowlist does not look:
 * a field the server reads and the action omits does not degrade the result, it destroys the run.
 * `flaggedPaths` and `errorPaths` were both omitted, so both §4.3 flagged paths and the Ext-5
 * error-path rules recomputed as OFF. A customer using either knob saw their CI fail exactly as
 * configured, and then the upload refused with a bare "HTTP 400" — no evidence, no check run, no
 * dashboard row, and nothing anywhere saying which field was missing.
 *
 * `errorHandlers` is the other half of the Ext-5 rule and was never emitted at all. Sending the
 * policy without it is still broken: the server reads failOnUntested: true against a count of zero
 * and recomputes a pass. Both travel or neither helps, which is why they are asserted together.
 *
 * Adding an input to the server's recompute means adding it here in the same change.
